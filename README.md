Habit Tracker App
====

### Project Overview
In this project the goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components. 

### Why this project?
In this project we learned about data storage in a SQLite database on Android. This is critical if we want to make any app that persists a userâ€™s data over time or syncs with an online database for offline use. 

### What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:

* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.
